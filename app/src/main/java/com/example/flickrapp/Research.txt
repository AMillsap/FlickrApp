1. What is Reactive Programming?
    Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams. It is being able to create
    data streams of anything and be able to manipulate them and have them interact with each other
    while the program is running. You are able to influence other streams with ones that will be created.
2. What are cold observables?
    Cold observables are observables that only start pushing when something subscribes to it and will
    start over if you subscribe again to it.
3. What are hot observables?
    Hot observables are observables that are pushing even when you are not subscribed to it.
4. What is back pressure when talking about RxJava?
    Backpressure is when an observable is firing off events faster than an operator is able to take
    them in.
